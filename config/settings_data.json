faq question -->\n        <h1 class=\"faq-page\">Why are your dog shoes so pricey?<\/h1>\n        <!-- faq answer -->\n        <div class=\"faq-body\">\n            <p>We know... our shoes are pricey, especially for dog shoes. But we want to make sure that our dogs get the same premium quality and comfort that our own shoes are made from. Lowering the cost means that our shoes wouldn't be tested by our veterinarian partner for safety and protection against man-made elements. If they weren’t worth the price, they wouldn't be recommended by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rover.com\/blog\/reviews\/best-dog-boots\/\">Rover<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesprucepets.com\/best-dog-boots-4589879\">The Spruce Pets<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/dogspotted.com\/dog-booties\/\">Dog Spotted<\/a>. RIFRUF® is not cheap, and that’s kind of the point.  P. S. Don’t be fooled by the dog shoe brands that sell a seemingly low price, when they’re actually only selling one pair of shoes. Our price reflects all 4 sneakers so that you have a full set right out of the box. <\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <hr class=\"hr-line\">\n   \n    <div>\n        <!-- faq question -->\n        <h1 class=\"faq-page\">What size should I get for my dog?<\/h1>\n        <!-- faq answer -->\n        <div class=\"faq-body\">\n            <p>Our smart breed size guide provides sizing recommendations based on your dog's weight and breed. If you want to measure your pup's paws, we also offer an easy measuring guide that takes less than 5 minutes. We also have a size guide video to help determine the right size for your dog; simply scroll up on this page to the \"Help Section\" video section.

We're an inclusive brand and believe in shoes for all dogs. Our shoes come in sizes 0 to 7, meaning they'll fit pups up to 120 lbs.

We exist in a day and age where our canine companions live side-by-side with us and walk on \"unnatural\" man-made environments: burning asphalt, salted ice and snow, broken glass, you name it. Dog paw pads are tough, but nature didn't make them to be indestructible. Do your dog a favor and give them the shoes that they deserve.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <hr class=\"hr-line\">\n    <div>\n        <!-- faq question -->\n        <h1 class=\"faq-page\">My dog has bigger front paws than back paws.

All sizes with a \"\/\" in them come with 2 shoes in one size, and 2 shoes in the other.

Some dogs will take longer than others to adjust, but with practice, patience, and lots of praise, your dog will get adjusted to wearing RIFRUFs on the streets or the runway. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/UD0NnfPPEx8\">tips & tricks video<\/a> gives helpful pointers on getting your pup acclimated to wearing our shoes.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <hr class=\"hr-line\">\n    <div>\n        <!-- faq question -->\n        <h1 class=\"faq-page\">What is your exchange\/return policy?<\/h1>\n        <!-- faq answer -->\n        <div class=\"faq-body\">\n            <p>In the event your pup's shoes aren't the right fit, we offer hassle-free exchanges and returns through our <a href=\"https:\/\/returns.rifrufqueens.com\/\">self-serve return portal<\/a>.

There are 3 ways to wear the leash: hands-free over the shoulder, hands-free around the waist, or around your wrist \/ hand. The methods of wear are enabled by the single sliding hardware that can be pulled up and down the leash, which accommodates your activity of choice. Maybe you need a free hand or two to carry some bags while walking your pup, or you prefer having your leash wrapped around your hand. Regardless of your walking style, the Commuter Leash is with you from point A to point Z.<br><br>\nThe leash additionally can withstand up to 650 lbs of force, while its clip hardware can withstand up to 400 lbs of force for dogs that tend to pull.

But we want to make sure that our dogs get the same premium quality and comfort that our own shoes are made from. Lowering the cost means that our shoes wouldn't be tested by our veterinarian partner for safety and protection against man-made elements. If they weren’t worth the price, they wouldn't be recommended by <a href=\"\/blog\/reviews\/best-dog-boots\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rover<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesprucepets.com\/best-dog-boots-4589879\" target=\"_blank\">The Spruce Pets<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/dogspotted.com\/dog-booties\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dog Spotted<\/a>. RIFRUF® is not cheap, and that’s kind of the point.  P. S. Don’t be fooled by the dog shoe brands that sell a seemingly low price, when they’re actually only selling one pair of shoes.
